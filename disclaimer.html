				<p style="margin:80px;float:left;">News India is an official website working since 2018. Here we provide the list of Top 10 of everything in the World and especially in India. We love what we do. The admiration and passion flow 
				naturally with each project we take up – and that simple emotion acts like a physical connection through the touch of a key transcending into how we strum a string in the mind of our viewers.

<br><br>The world is changing. It has always has been – we’d be eating raw meat in a cave otherwise. And in the digital world of today, consuming content has become as unsatisfying, and unhealthy.
<br><br>Sponsorship has made news and media motive drove – and more than state-sponsored censorship, internal hesitation kills half of the truth. And that is precisely the spark we needed to establish It as an alternate platform. Consumer-centric, but not consumer driven.
<br><br><img src="images/enews1.png" height="200" width="500"><br><br>
Connecting world to the individual through the knowledge is over main motive and when we talk about the knowledge the first thing comes to our mind to know are the top, best and interesting facts about the thing or object. So here with the theme of providing the list of top, best, and interesting facts about everything,
 we are working all day and night. To keep in touch and to share the knowledge subscribe our website or do follow on social media and be a part of our journey.
