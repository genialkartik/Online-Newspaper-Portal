California Online Privacy Protection Act
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online
 services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to
  require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
   operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers 
   to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being
    collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at:
     http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
Users can visit our site anonymously.

 on the first significant page after entering our website.
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.

      • On our Privacy Policy Page
Can change your personal information:
      • By logging in to your account
How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?
We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when 
a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?
It’s also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking

COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years
 old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal 
 Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which 
 spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.

We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?

Fair Information Practices
The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States
 and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection 
 laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should 
 be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
